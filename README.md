# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews

The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude, opinion, or sentiment of the writer towards a particular topic, product, or service. Sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews involves analyzing these user-generated reviews to determine the sentiment towards a particular movie.

In the context of IMDB movie reviews, sentiment analysis involves classifying the reviews as positive, negative. This project is focused on comparing different text representations and learning models on a classification task.

In this project, I worked with a large supervised dataset of English IMDB Movie reviews. I explored three text representation strategies and four classifiers to perform sentiment analysis on the movie reviews. The aim was to compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing models.

### Text Representation Strategies

**1.Bag-of-Words (BoW):** This approach represents each document as a vector of word frequencies, ignoring the order in which the words occur.

**2.TF-IDF:** This approach is similar to BoW, but it also considers the importance of each word in the document and across the corpus.

**3.Doc2Vec (d2v):** This approach represents each document as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where similar documents are located closer together.

### Classifiers

Evaluated four classifiers:

**1.Logistic Regression**

**2.Decision Tree Classifier**

3.Random Forest Classifier

4.Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
